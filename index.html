          <span class="mini">3d printing Homes</span>, With 3D printing, materials are joined together or
          reinforced by using a computer -controlled device to create a
          three-dimensional object. We have partnered with fellow tech companies
          to ease homelessness around the world by building affordable homes
          using 3D printing. We have developed a method for printing a
          one-floor, 60-square-meter house out of cement in a day for just
          $10,000. This is a fraction of both the time and cost needed to build
          a similar construction using conventional methods.

          <span class="mini">Modular Homes Processing</span>, Modular Off-Site Building
          can reduce build time significantly. homes are those created in panels or other large sections off-site. 
          These panels are later delivered to the building site and assembled into a home. 
          This can reduce build time significantly, 
          from months or years to days or weeks, 
          while limiting associated costs. Another reason modular homes benefit the homeless is because of sustainability. 
          Modular units can be built in one location at a fast rate, can be assembled, 
          transported and established elsewhere 
          and can then be disassembled, removed, relocated and reassembled as and when needed.
