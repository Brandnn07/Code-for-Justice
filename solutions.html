          <span class="mini">3d printing Homes</span>, With 3D printing, materials are joined together or
          reinforced by using a computer -controlled device to create a
          three-dimensional object. We have partnered with fellow tech companies
          to ease homelessness around the world by building affordable homes
          using 3D printing. We have developed a method for printing a
          one-floor, 60-square-meter house out of cement in a day for just
          $10,000. This is a fraction of both the time and cost needed to build
          a similar construction using conventional methods.

          <span class="mini">Modular Homes Processing</span>, Modular Off-Site Building
          can reduce build time significantly. homes are those created in panels or other large sections off-site. 
          These panels are later delivered to the building site and assembled into a home. 
          This can reduce build time significantly, 
          from months or years to days or weeks, 
          while limiting associated costs. Another reason modular homes benefit the homeless is because of sustainability. 
          Modular units can be built in one location at a fast rate, can be assembled, 
          transported and established elsewhere 
          and can then be disassembled, removed, relocated and reassembled as and when needed.

          and credit scores to help them achieve Homeownership. We established a platform that transforms a renter's ability to pay, stay, 
          and thrive in their home by using real-time data to develop payment solutions to address their needs. 
          These personalized structures reduce the avoidable costs of delinquency and eviction.

          <span class="mini">Helping Hand</span>,Our program helps prevent evictions and, in worst cases, homelessness.
          The ASSIST program could provide temporary financial assistance to help cover rent for households experiencing unexpected economic shocks 
          (e.g., loss of work hours, unreimbursed medical bills, a broken-down car). 
          Coupled with stability services, such as counselors and legal aid, 
          this program would extend an emergency cushion to low-income people in crisis, 
          helping them avert the downward spiral of housing instability and homelessness.
